这是一条严正声明，阅读公告后您仍然选择留在我们的网站，即视为您同意以下条款。

<!-- truncate -->

近期我们将开始对于卧软杯数理化联合大赛（以下简称“卧软杯”）的宣传工作，我们所作的一切宣传工作仅限于宣传，没有任何强制意义，若您不喜欢卧软杯这一形式，您可以选择忽略或退出。但是，我们希望您在退出之前，听到您的相关意见。卧软杯创立于15班，但并不意味着15班的全体成员必须成为卧软杯的选手，也并不意味着卧软杯对于其他班级选手持不友好态度，我们欢迎来自其他班级、其他年级的同学作为选手加入。

近期，我们接到反馈，有部分选手提出了正向建议，我们将在之后的时间里优化页面布局，并应多数人的要求降低题目难度。化学、物理部分的难度基本与第0期持平，不再增加难度，数学部分的难度予以适当降低并考虑变换题目形式。

我们对选手们提出的建议深表认同，同时我们也接到了对于卧软杯的一些争议。我们希望能够消除对于卧软杯的某些偏见和误解。以及不要把对于组织者或出题人的不满转化为对于卧软杯项目的否定。我们的初衷在于建立一个学术交流的友好环境，一切都基于兴趣和自由选择，而非将卧软杯做成某班的“名片”，人为做成某种“精神”的“象征”，更非意在引起某些人的反感或挑起群体对立。目前，我们正在考虑是否加入适当的奖励机制，以鼓励更多人加入卧软杯。我们希望出题人团队能有新人加入。

无论存在的选手多或少，卧软杯都将一直运行下去。

此公告。

This is a solemn statement that if you choose to remain on our website after reading the announcement, you agree to the following terms.

Recently, we will start the publicity work for the Wo Ruan Prize Math, Physics and Chemistry Competition (hereinafter referred to as “WRP”). All the publicity work we do is limited to publicity, without any mandatory significance. If you don’t like the form of WRP, you can choose to ignore or quit. However, we want you to hear from us before you withdraw. WRP was founded in Class 15, but it does not mean that all members of Class 15 must become WRP players, nor does it mean that WRP is unfriendly to other class players, we welcome students from other classes and other grades to join as players.

Recently, we received feedback, some players put forward positive suggestions, we will optimize the page layout in the future, and in response to the majority of people’s request to reduce the difficulty of the question. The difficulty of chemistry and physics is basically the same as that of phase 0, no longer increasing the difficulty, and the difficulty of mathematics is appropriately reduced and the form of the question is considered.

We strongly agree with the suggestions made by the players, and we have also received some controversy about the WRP. We hope to eliminate some of the prejudices and misconceptions about WRP. And don’t turn your dissatisfaction with the organizer or the question maker into a denial of the project. Our original intention is to establish a friendly environment for academic exchange, all based on interest and free choice, rather than turning the WRP into a “business card” of a class, artificially making it a “symbol” of a “spirit”, and not intended to cause some people’s aversion or provoke group opposition. At present, we are considering whether to include appropriate incentive mechanisms to encourage more people to join the WRP. We’re hoping to get some new people on the quiz team.

No matter how many players there are, the WRP will always run.
